### Step-by-Step Process for Improved Heart Failure Prediction Project Workflow

This guide outlines a comprehensive, zero-cost workflow to enhance your existing Jupyter notebook-based heart failure prediction project into a major project-worthy system. It incorporates machine learning improvements, a user-facing web app, healthcare recommendations, and deployment, all using free tools as discussed. The workflow is divided into phases: Preparation, Development, Testing, Documentation, and Deployment. Follow sequentially, assuming you have Python installed and a GitHub account (free).

#### Phase 1: Preparation (Setup Environment and Data)
1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Install required free libraries via pip (run in terminal): `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost catboost imbalanced-learn shap streamlit plotly pandas-profiling pytest aif360 sqlite3`.
   - Clone your existing GitHub repo: `git clone https://github.com/anik199/Heart-failure-prediction.git`.
   - Create a new branch for enhancements: `git checkout -b feature/enhancements`.
   - Organize folders: Create `src/` for code, `data/` for datasets (place `heart.csv` here), `app/` for Streamlit files, `tests/` for tests, and `docs/` for documentation.

2. **Gather and Prepare Data**:
   - Use the existing `heart.csv` (918 samples).
   - Download an additional free dataset (e.g., UCI Heart Disease from `archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease` – free CSV). Save as `uci_heart.csv` in `data/`.
   - Merge datasets in a new script (`src/data_prep.py`): Use pandas to align columns (e.g., rename if needed), handle missing values, and save as `combined_heart.csv`.
   - Create a static hospital database: Download a free CSV of hospitals (e.g., from Kaggle "US Hospitals" dataset, free). Filter to cardiologist-relevant entries, save as `hospitals.csv` in `data/` with columns: Name, Address, City, State.

#### Phase 2: Development (Enhance ML Pipeline and Build Features)
3. **Improve Data Preprocessing**:
   - In `src/preprocess.py`: Load data with pandas. Handle categorical encoding (OneHotEncoder from scikit-learn), scale numerical features (StandardScaler).
   - Add class imbalance handling: Use SMOTE from imbalanced-learn on training data only.
   - Implement feature selection: Use SelectKBest from scikit-learn to select top 7 features based on chi2 or f_classif scores.

4. **Enhance Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - In `src/train.py`: Train multiple models – XGBoost, CatBoost (existing), RandomForestClassifier, and SVC from scikit-learn.
   - Use 5-fold cross-validation (KFold from scikit-learn) and evaluate with metrics (accuracy_score, classification_report from scikit-learn).
   - Add explainability: Train the best model (e.g., CatBoost), then use SHAP to generate explanations (shap.summary_plot with matplotlib).
   - Compare models: Create a pandas DataFrame table of metrics and visualize with seaborn (e.g., bar plot).

5. **Add Fairness Analysis**:
   - In `src/fairness.py`: Use AIF360 to check bias (e.g., BinaryLabelDataset, Reweighing for mitigation).
   - Focus on protected attributes like `Sex` or `Age` groups. Generate a report: "Bias metric: 0.05 (low bias)".

6. **Build Healthcare Features**:
   - In `src/recommendations.py`: Create rule-based functions.
     - Lifestyle advice: If prediction probability > 0.7 and `Cholesterol` high, return strings like "Consider a low-fat diet and exercise."
     - Hospital suggestions: Load `hospitals.csv` with pandas. Filter by user-input city/state (e.g., df[df['City'] == user_city]).
   - Use SQLite for scalability: In `src/database.py`, create a database from CSV (`sqlite3.connect('heart.db')`, then `df.to_sql('hospitals', conn)`).

7. **Develop the Streamlit Web App**:
   - Create `app/main.py`: Use Streamlit for UI.
     - Inputs: Sliders/dropdowns for features (e.g., st.slider('Age', 20, 100)).
     - Prediction: Load trained model (pickle it from `train.py`), predict on inputs.
     - Outputs: Display risk level (color-coded text), SHAP explanation plot, recommendations, and filtered hospitals (st.dataframe).
     - Add batch mode: st.file_uploader for CSV, process with pandas, output table.
     - Visuals: Use Plotly for interactive charts (e.g., px.bar for feature comparison).
   - Run locally: `streamlit run app/main.py`.

#### Phase 3: Testing (Ensure Reliability)
8. **Unit and Integration Testing**:
   - In `tests/test_preprocess.py`, etc.: Use pytest to test functions (e.g., `def test_scaling(): assert scaled_data.mean() ≈ 0`).
   - Test ML: Mock inputs, check predictions match expected.
   - Test app: Manually input edge cases (e.g., invalid age= -5, ensure error handling).
   - Run tests: `pytest tests/`.

9. **Automated EDA on New Data**:
   - In `src/eda.py`: Use pandas_profiling to generate HTML reports (`ProfileReport(df).to_file('eda_report.html')`).
   - Review for issues like outliers before training.

#### Phase 4: Documentation (Professional Polish)
10. **Write Documentation**:
    - Update README.md: Include project overview, setup (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), usage (run app), features, and screenshots.
    - Create report in `docs/report.md` (or PDF via free tools like Markdown to PDF): Cover problem, methodology, results (e.g., 91% accuracy), limitations (e.g., small data), future work (e.g., mobile app).
    - Add UML diagrams: Use diagrams.net (free online) for system architecture (e.g., data flow from input to prediction).

11. **Version Control**:
    - Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Added ML enhancements"`.
    - Push to GitHub: `git push origin feature/enhancements`.
    - Create a pull request and merge to main.

#### Phase 5: Deployment (Make It Accessible)
12. **Deploy the App for Free**:
    - Ensure `requirements.txt` lists all libraries (generate with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
    - Push to GitHub main branch.
    - Sign up at share.streamlit.io (free), connect your repo, and deploy. Get a public URL (e.g., https://your-app.streamlit.app).
    - Test deployment: Access via browser, ensure predictions and features work.

#### Final Notes
- **Time Estimate**: 4-8 weeks, depending on experience (1-2 weeks per phase).
- **Iteration**: After each phase, run the notebook/app to validate (e.g., accuracy >90%, app loads without errors).
- **Ethical Considerations**: Add disclaimers in the app ("Not a substitute for medical advice").
- **Monitoring Improvements**: Post-deployment, log user interactions locally (e.g., via SQLite) for future analysis.
- **Total Modules Used**: 16 (8 existing + 8 new: imblearn, shap, streamlit, plotly, sqlite3, pandas_profiling, pytest, aif360).

This workflow turns your project into a full-fledged system, emphasizing practicality and depth without any costs. If issues arise (e.g., library conflicts), debug using free resources like Stack Overflow.
